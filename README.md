## Installation

### Clone

```bash
# clone project
git clone https://github.com/MQED-transport/Macroscopic-Quantum-Electrodynamics.git
cd MacroscopicQED
```

### Conda/Mamba/Micromamba (recommended)

```bash
# choose one of: conda | mamba | micromamba
conda env create -f environmental.yaml   # create environment
conda activate mqed                      # activate environment
pip install -e .                         # install as editable package
```

### Pip only

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .                         # install package
```

<!-- ### MPI notes (optional)

To use the MPI‑based disorder sweeps you need an MPI implementation and `mpi4py` inside the same Python env.

```bash
# Install an MPI runtime first (OpenMPI or MPICH), then:
pip install mpi4py
# quick check
mpirun --version
``` -->

> **Tip:** If system MPI headers are unavailable on your machine, install via your package manager (e.g. `brew install open-mpi`, `apt install libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin`).

## Quick Start

### Console commands

This package installs the following command‑line tools (from `setup.py` entry points):

| Command              | What it does                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `mqed_GF`            | Run Dyadic Green’s function simulation           |
| `mqed_RET`           | Run RET analysis                                 |

| `mqed_plot_sqrt_msd` | Plot square‑root MSD from results                |

> All commands are configured via Hydra using YAML files under `configs/`. You can edit those files or override any key from the CLI.

### Examples

Run a Dyadic GF simulation with defaults:

```bash
mqed_GF
```

Override parameters inline (Hydra style):

```bash
mqed_GF simulation.energy=1.864
```
If you want to simulate multiple frequencies, you can choose List or Dict input:
```bash
mqed_GF simulation.energy.min=1.0 simulation.energy.max=2.0 simulation.energy.points=11
# This will simulate 11 energy sources betweeen (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, ... ,2.0 )eV
```
or:
```bash
mqed_GF simulation.energy_eV=[1.0,1.5,2.0]
#This will simulate 3 energy points as (1.0,1.5,2.0) eV
```
You can also change other simulation parameters in the configs/Dyadic_GF/GF_analytical.yaml:
```bash
    position:
        zD: 2.0e-9 # The height of donor at z-axis
        zD_nm: 2 # Key for name
        zA: 2.0e-9 # The height of acceptor at z-axis, default same height with donor in simulation.
        Rx_nm:  # This section defines the range of horizontal distances between donor and acceptor
        start: 1.0
        stop: 500.0
        points: 501  # This will give you points 1, 2, 3, ..., 500, total 501 points.
output:
    filename: "result_${simulation.material}_${simulation.position.zD_nm}_nm.hdf5" 
    #Or your own file name.
```
<!-- The output file will be saved to outputs/Dyadic_GF_analytical/%%Year-Month-Day/%%Hour-Min-S/.. -->
After simulation, either in terminal or in the outputs/Dyadic_GF_analytical/.../Dyadic_GF_analytical.log you will see:
```bash
2025-10-24 11:40:02.818 | SUCCESS  | mqed.Dyadic_GF.main:run_simulation:114 - Simulation complete. Output saved to: /.../MacroscopicQED/outputs/Dyadic_GF_analytical/Y-M-D/H-M-S/result_Ag_2_nm.hdf5

```
For post-process (Simulate QED or RET), the default path of Green's function is:
```bash
  ${oc.env:MQED_ROOT,${oc.env:PWD}}/data/GF_cache/result_Ag_2_nm_latest.hdf5
```
So you can create a subdirectory data/GF_cache/ and copy-paste the Green's function from the path "/.../MacroscopicQED/outputs/Dyadic_GF_analytical/Y-M-D/H-M-S/result_Ag_2_nm.hdf5".

Lindblad dynamics:

```bash
mqed_lindblad simulation.t_ps.start=0.0 simulation.t_ps.stop=150.0 simulation.t_ps.output_step=2e-3
```
You can also change the config files directly in configs/Lindblad/quantum_dynamics.yaml :
```bash
greens:
  h5_path: ${oc.env:MQED_ROOT,${oc.env:PWD}}/data/GF_cache/result_Ag_2_nm_latest.hdf5 # update as needed


# Simulation controls
simulation:
# time grid in picoseconds
  t_ps:
    start: 0.0
    stop: 150.0
    output_step: 5e-3


# system
  Nmol: 100 # number of sites
  d_nm: 3.0 # lattice spacing (nm)


# dipoles / orientation
  mu_D_debye: 3.8
  mu_A_debye: 3.8
  theta_deg: 90.0
  phi_deg: magic # or a number
  mode: stationary # or 'disorder'
```
The program will read Green's function data from /data/GF_cache/result_Ag_2_nm_latest.hdf5 for calculating dipole-dipole interaction matrix. However, you can also overrite the path for the parameter you are interested by command line:
```bash
mqed_lindblad greens.h5_path=YOUR_PATH
```
Here the path directly comes from the absolute path after simulation '/.../MacroscopicQED/outputs/Dyadic_GF_analytical/Y-M-D/H-M-S/result_Ag_2_nm.hdf5' as mentioned in Dyadic Green's function simulation. Or you can manually overwrite the yaml file in configs/Lindblad/quantum_dynamics.yaml file.

NHSE dynamics:
The equivalent Non-Hermitian Schodinger equation(NHSE) is implemented here which gives identical result with Lindblad dynamic as we tested. We recommend NHSE for large simulation since it is much faster than simulate density matrix in general.
You can overwrite the simulation parameter as:
```bash
mqed_nhse simulation.t_ps.start=0.0 simulation.t_ps.stop=100.0 simulation.t_ps.output_step=2e-3
```
You can also change the config files directly in configs/Lindblad/quantum_dynamics.yaml.
```bash
simulation:
# time grid in picoseconds
  t_ps:
    start: 0.0
    stop: 150.0
    output_step: 5e-3


# system
  Nmol: 100 # number of sites
  d_nm: 3.0 # lattice spacing (nm)


# dipoles / orientation
  mu_D_debye: 3.8
  mu_A_debye: 3.8
  theta_deg: 90.0
  phi_deg: magic # or a number
  mode: stationary # or 'disorder'
  # disorder_sigma_phi_deg: 15.0 # uncomment for disordered orientations
```

Disorder sweep (multi process):

```bash
mqed_nhse_disorder simulation.disorder_sigma_phi_deg=8.0 initial_state.site_index=51
# Give the std of azimuthal angle as 8.0 and the initial excitation at the middle of 100 molecules.
```

Disorder sweep with MPI (8 ranks):
Not test yet.
<!-- ```bash
mpirun -n 8 mqed_nhse_disorder disorder.n_samples=400
``` -->

Plot MSD and √MSD:

```bash
mqed_plot_msd 
mqed_plot_sqrt_msd 
```
The configs/plots/sqrt_msd.yaml and configs/plots/msd.yaml are configure file for root mean square displacement and mean square displacement, they look identical.
```bash
curves:
  - label: "Magic-Angle"
    use_latest_glob: "${oc.env:MQED_ROOT,${oc.env:PWD}}/data/QDyn_cache/silver_stationary_latest.hdf5"  
    style: "-"         # matplotlib line format
    lw: 1.5
  - label: "σ=10"
    use_latest_glob: "${oc.env:MQED_ROOT,${oc.env:PWD}}/data/QDyn_cache/silver_sigma10_avg_latest.hdf5" 
    style: "-"         # e.g., "C1-"
    lw: 1.5
```
This part gives the curve you want to plot, 'use_latest_glob' gives the path of the file, 'label' gives the label in the final plot, 'lw' is the line-width parameter from plot, 'style' is the line style. The users can change the parameter as they prefer, see: https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/linestyles.html for line style. 

If the users want to plot single/multiple lines, they can delete/add from the template. 
```bash
curves:
  - label: "YOUR LABEL"
    use_latest_glob: "YOUR PATH"  
    style: "YOUR STYLE"         # matplotlib line format
    lw: 1.5
# This one is single plot

```bash
curves:
  - label: "YOUR LABEL"
    use_latest_glob: "YOUR PATH"  
    style: "-"         # matplotlib line format
    lw: 1.5
  - label: "YOUR LABEL"
    use_latest_glob: "YOUR PATH" 
    style: "-"         # e.g., "C1-"
    lw: 1.5
  - label: "YOUR LABEL"
    use_latest_glob: "YOUR PATH" 
    style: "YOUR STYLE"         # e.g., "C1-"
    lw: 1.5
    #This one is for multiple curves plot
```

The plot settings can also be changed by users' preferences: (See matplotlib documentation for instruction: https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index)
```bash
plot_settings:
  save_plot: true
  filename: "silver_middle_sqrt_msd.png"
  dpi: 400
  show: false
  tight_layout: true
  grid: true
  legend: true
  figsize: [7.5, 5.0]

  # x selection (time). Choose one: x_range_ps or x_index_range
  x_range_ps: [0.0, 150.0]   # in picoseconds
  # x_index_range: [0, 500]

  # axis labels, scales, limits
  xlabel: "t (ps)"            # or "t (s)" if you keep in s
  ylabel: "$\\Delta x$ (nm)"
  title: "Silver; Middle Excitation"
  xscale: linear             # or "log"
  yscale: linear
  xlim: null
  ylim: null

  # optional multiply time axis (e.g., to show ×10^-10 s visually):
  x_scale_factor: 1.0        # keep 1.0 if you already saved 't_ps' in seconds; use 1e-12 to convert ps→s
  lw: 1.5
```

## Configuration (Hydra)

* Base config directory: `configs/`
* Notable groups:

  * `configs/Lindblad/` — quantum dynamics solver settings, user can change simulation method (`Lindblad`,`NonHermitian`), evaluation time steps, intermolecular distance(`d_nm`), dipole orientations(`theta_deg`, `phi_deg`, dipole strength of donor and acceptor.). The stationary orientation simulation is controlled by 'quantum_dynamics.yaml' and disorder-orientation simulation is controlled by 'quantum_dynamics_disorder.yaml'. 

  -Warning: The number of molecules (`Nmol`) times the intermolecular distance (`d_nm`) has to be less than the Dyadic Green's function simulation of horizental distance, i.e, if user's Dyadic Green's function simulates the horizental distance (`Rx_nm`) as 501 points starting from 0.0 to 500nm, (which is `Rx_nm.start=0.0, Rx_nm.stop=500.0, Rx_nm.points=501`) but user inputs 100 molecules(`Nmol=100`) of distance 6nm(`d_nm=6.0`), the program will **abort** since 100*6=600>= 500 (in Dyadic Green's function).
  * `configs/Dyadic_GF/` — geometry/material settings for Dyadic Green's function simulation on planar surface. User can change the dipole source frequency as **single value**, **dictionary of a range of values** or **list of some values** for multi-frequency simulation. The position is referred to **z-axis height** of donor and acceptor on the surface. `Rx_nm` is the *horizental distance* between donor and acceptor, i.e, source and response. For the material of user's interest, user may fit a dielectric function by him- or herself and append to the current excel sheet or create new .xlsx file to overwrite the default path and sheet name for the simulation.
  * `configs/analysis/` — RET and plotting parameters. User can change the parameter of donor and acceptor to evaluate the system of interest. Plot-setting parts can be customized by user's preference with the reference of matplotlib.
  * `configs/plots/`: `msd.yaml`, `sqrt_msd.yaml` - The two plot settings for the **mean square displacement (MSD)** or **root mean square displacement (RMSD)**. User can change the part of `curves` to customize the curves of interest with corresponding labels and data path. The plot settings can also be customized by user's preference.

Override any key from the CLI:

```bash
mqed_lindblad +experiment=my_note simulation.t_ps.stop=10.0 simulation.t_ps.output_step=1e-3
```

Hydra organizes outputs under `outputs/` and keeps copies of the used configs for reproducibility. Heavy intermediates may be cached under `data/`.

## Troubleshooting

* **Command not found** after install: make sure the env is activated and `pip install -e .` completed without errors.
* **MPI errors**: verify `mpirun` exists on PATH and `mpi4py` is installed in the active env.
* **Missing config**: ensure the specified YAML exists under `configs/` or list available options in that folder.
* **Plot scripts**: check that `curves` points to a completed run directory containing the expected logs/data.

---

## Beta Test:
* **Prerequisite:** Install the package as introduced in **Installation**.
* **Step1:** After install the package, run `mqed_GF simulation.energy_eV=1.864` in the ternimal, it will generate `result_Ag_2nm.hdf5` file under subdirectory `outputs/Dyadic_GF_analytical/Y-M-D/H-M-S/`. Create a new subdirectory named `data/GF_cache` under the root directory (See project layout), copy-paste the hdf5 file into `data/GF_cache/` and **rename it** as `result_Ag_2_nm_latest.hdf5`, which means simulation of donor on the height 2nm of silver planar surface. 
* **Step2:** Run `mqed_RET` in the terminal, it will generate `enhancement_magic_angle_1.864eV.png` file under subdirectory `outputs/RET/Y-M-D/H-M-S/`. This result is the enhancement electric field of dipole emitting energy with value **1.864eV** with the azimuthal angle of both donor and acceptor is magic-angle(**arcos(1/sqrt(3))**). The X-axis is the horizental distance between donor and acceptor. You should get same result as `enhancement_magic_angle_1.864eV.png` under subdirectory `Beta_Test/`.
* **Step3:** Run `mqed_nhse initial_state.site_index=51` in the terminal, it will generate `silver_stationary_latest.hdf5` file under subdirectory `outputs/Lindblad/Y-M-D/H-M-S/`. This result represents the quantum dynamics of molecular aggregate aligned on the silver surface with their azimuthal angle at magic angle. Copy-paste the`silver_stationary_latest.hdf5` file into subdirectory `data/QDyn_cache/`(**create this subdirectory first**) without rename the file.

Here is the reference plot for this step:
  <p align="center">
    <img src="Beta_Test/enhancement_magic_angle_1.864eV.png" alt="Reference result for Step 3" width="500">
  </p>
* **Step4** Run multiple different commands:

```bash
mqed_nhse_disorder simulation.disorder_sigma_phi_deg=10
mqed_nhse_disorder simulation.disorder_sigma_phi_deg=30
mqed_nhse_disorder simulation.disorder_sigma_phi_deg=50
```

After those commands, there will be multiple files name as `silver_sigma${disorder_sigma_phi_deg}_avg_latest.hdf5` (The **disorder_sigma_phi_deg** is the value of your input, i.e, **3,10,30,50**)generated under the subdirectories `outputs/NHSE/Y-M-D/H-M-S/`. The file path will show up in the terminal or you can find them under the file `outputs/NHSE/Y-M-D/H-M-S/NHSE_disorder.log`. Copy-paste those `silver_sigma${disorder_sigma_phi_deg}_avg_latest.hdf5` into subdirectory `data/QDyn_cache/`.
* **Step5:** After **Step4**, you should have `silver_stationary_latest.hdf5` and multiple `silver_sigma${disorder_sigma_phi_deg}_avg_latest.hdf5` files under the `data/QDyn_cache/`. Make sure you have following `curves` part in the `configs/plots/sqrt_msd.yaml`:

```bash
curves:
  - label: "Magic-Angle"
    use_latest_glob: "${oc.env:MQED_ROOT,${oc.env:PWD}}/data/QDyn_cache/silver_stationary_latest.hdf5"  # or using "outputs/Lindblad/.../qdyn_result.hdft"
    style: "-"         # matplotlib line format
    lw: 1.5
  - label: "σ=10"
    use_latest_glob: "${oc.env:MQED_ROOT,${oc.env:PWD}}/data/QDyn_cache/silver_sigma10_avg_latest.hdf5" # or using "outputs/NHSE_disorder/.../qdyn_disorder_avg.hdft"
    style: "-"         # e.g., "C1-"
    lw: 1.5
  - label: "σ=30"
    use_latest_glob: "${oc.env:MQED_ROOT,${oc.env:PWD}}/data/QDyn_cache/silver_sigma30_avg_latest.hdf5" # or using "outputs/NHSE_disorder/.../qdyn_disorder_avg.hdft"
    style: "-"         # e.g., "C1-"
    lw: 1.5
  - label: "σ=50"
    use_latest_glob: "${oc.env:MQED_ROOT,${oc.env:PWD}}/data/QDyn_cache/silver_sigma50_avg_latest.hdf5" # or using "outputs/NHSE_disorder/.../qdyn_disorder_avg.hdft"
    style: "-"         # e.g., "C1-"
    lw: 1.5
```

Run `mqed_plot_sqrt_msd` and you should get a file `silver_middle_sqrt_msd.png` under the subdirectory `outputs/plot_sqrt_msd/Y-M-D/H-M-S/`. You should get the same result under the `Beta_Test/silver_middle_sqrt_msd.png`.

Here is the reference of the figure:
